# GoRide Assignment App

This is a simple embedded Shopify app installed on [fake store](gorideassignement.myshopify.com).
It responds to two simple tasks:
  - Update the store's products title in some way on the hour every hour.
  - Provides an interface to for the user where they can adjust the fake products price manually.

The app scaffold was generated throught Shopify-CLI and modified accordingly.
